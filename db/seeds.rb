Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost twin-engine airliner derived from Boeing's 707 and 727, the 737 has developed into a family of nine passenger models with a capacity of 85 to 215 passengers. The 737 is Boeing's only narrow-body airliner in production, with the -600, -700, -800, and -900ER variants currently being built. A re-engined and redesigned version, the 737 MAX, is set to debut in 2017.", image_url: 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/737-100_N73700.jpg' },
  { name: 'Bell X-1', desc: "The Bell X-1, originally designated XS-1, was a joint NACA-U.S. Army Air Forces-U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by the Bell Aircraft Company. Conceived in 1944 and designed and built during 1945, it reached nearly 1,000 m.p.h. (1,600 km/h) in 1948. A derivative of this same design, the Bell X-1A, having greater fuel capacity and hence longer rocket burning time, exceeded 1,600 m.p.h. (2,575 km/h) in 1954.[1] The X-1 was the first airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and was the first of the so-called X-planes, an American series of experimental rocket planes designated for testing of new technologies and often kept secret.", image_url: 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Bell_X-1_color.jpg' },
  { name: 'Concorde', desc: "Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde is a retired turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner or supersonic transport (SST). It is one of only two SSTs to have entered commercial service; the other was the Tupolev Tu-144. Concorde was jointly developed and produced by Aerospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued commercial flights for 27 years.", image_url: 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/British_Airways_Concorde_G-BOAC_03.jpg/800px-British_Airways_Concorde_G-BOAC_03.jpg' },

The design, publicly unveiled in January 1962, was constructed under the direction of the Soviet Tupolev design bureau, headed by Alexei Tupolev.[1]", image_url: 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/RIAN_archive_566221_Tu-144_passenger_airliner.jpg/800px-RIAN_archive_566221_Tu-144_passenger_airliner.jpg' },

  { name: 'Glider', desc: "Glider is a heavier-than-air aircraft that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces, and whose free flight does not depend on an engine.[1] Mostly these types of aircraft are intended for routine operation without engines, though engine failure can force other types of aircraft to become gliders. Some gliders have engines for extending their flight, and some have engines powerful enough to launch into the air.", image_url: 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Dg800.jpg' },
  { name: 'Albatros II', desc: "Le Bris built a glider, inspired by the shape of the Albatross and named L'Albatros artificiel (\"The artificial Albatross\"). During 1856 he flew briefly on the beach of Sainte-Anne-la-Palud (Plonevez-Porzay, Finistere), the aircraft being placed on a cart towed by a horse.[1] He thus flew higher than his point of departure, a first for heavier-than-air flying machines, reportedly to a height of 100 m (330 ft), for a distance of 200 m (660 ft).", image_url: 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/LeBris1868.jpg' } ])
